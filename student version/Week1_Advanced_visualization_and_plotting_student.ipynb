You should be familiar with the Python programming language and using Jupyter Notebooks at this point, but as this is the first module of this course, you may find that you need a refresher on some material. You are encouraged to review material from your previous coursework within this week before the semester picks up!\n",

    "      * Add title, labels, and legend for plots\n",
